        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>
                <h3>Prep the bread</h3>
                <p>
                    Spread the dried bread cubes into a large bowl.
                    (If your bread isn't fully dried, toast cubes in a 300°F oven for
                    20-30 minutes until crisp.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Sauté the vegetables</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the onion and celery.</li>
                    <li>Cook 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and fragrant but not browned.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Stir in the sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.
                    Let the spices bloom in the butter for about 30 seconds.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Combine with bread</h3>
                <p>
                    Pour the sautéed vegetables and butter over the bread cubes.
                    Add the chopped parsley.
                    Mix gently until the bread is coated.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add broth (and eggs if using)</h3>
                <p>
                    Slowly pour in the broth, starting with 2 cups.
                    Toss until the bread is evenly moistened but not soggy.
                    If using eggs, stir them in now—they help bind the stuffing and make it richer.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Transfer to a baking dish</h3>
                <p>
                    Spread the mixture into a greased 9 by 13 baking dish.
                    Press lightly to even it out but don't pack too tightly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Bake</h3>
                <p>
                    Bake at 350°F (177°C) for 35-45 minutes, or until the top is lightly 
                    golden and the center is set.
